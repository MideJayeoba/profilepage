        <p>
    Hi, I‚Äôm Mide Jayeoba ‚Äî full-stack software developer by day, guitar-slinging code poet by night, and occasional debugger of real-life problems (still working on patching the sleep cycle).
    
    I study Computer Science at FUTA, but honestly, most of my ‚Äúlectures‚Äù come from breaking stuff and fixing it again with Python, Django, and a cup of coffee that‚Äôs probably cold. I build full-stack apps that actually work (most times), and I‚Äôm currently working on cool things like an audiobook web app that merges AI, text-to-speech magic, and PDF wizardry.
    
    I‚Äôm also the PRO of ACOMS, where I turn announcements into engagement and sometimes memes (strategic ones, of course). Add music to the mix ‚Äî I teach, play, and compose on the acoustic guitar ‚Äî and you‚Äôve got a blend of art and logic that keeps me sane.
    
    My vibe? Build it. Break it. Understand it. Build it better.
    
    Let‚Äôs create something awesome ‚Äî or at least something that compiles.
        </p>

        <p>When I‚Äôm not refactoring logic or designing a backend architecture, I‚Äôm composing music, playing acoustic guitar, or organizing jam sessions. I believe music and code are both languages ‚Äî and I happen to speak both fluently.</p>
